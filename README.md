## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation

### What I learned

On this project, I could learn a lot about DOM Manipulation and how to use it as a bridge between the user and the code.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - DOM Manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) - This helped me a lot to understand how the DOM works and how to implement it.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-manipulate-the-dom-beginners-guide/) - Here I understood some really useful concepts about the DOM like the DOM tree.
